### Introduction

After reviewing the **[microbiotaPair](https://github.com/rusher321/microbiotaPair)** package generated by my former tutor, building my own package for daily data analysis seems very necessary. Firstly, taking the schematic overview of microbiotaPair into account to reorganize the **MyRtools**. and then fulfilling all the missing modules in the methods part.

### Installation

```R
 if(!require(devtools)){
     install.packages("devtools")
 }
devtools::install_github("HuaZou/MyRtools")
library(MyRtools)
```
